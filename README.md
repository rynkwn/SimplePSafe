# PSafe

A simple password safe. Process is pretty simple.

1) Move the .jar file where you want to keep your encrypted password files. (A dropbox folder would be good.)
2) Run the app. First, you'll create a master password that encrypts the master file.
3) Then, you can add new passwords. Every new password is encrypted using a 60 character Alphanumeric + symbols string (which is then hashed).
4) To read a password, just copy and paste the appropriate filename into the Input box. They'll be pretty readily available.
